1.0b7 - 2011-06-12
------------------

* Moved the *views* and *overrides* plugins out into a separate package
  ``plone.app.themingplugins``. If you want to use those features, you need
  to install that package in your buildout. Themes attempting to register
  views or overrides in environments where ``plone.app.themingplugins`` is not
  installed will install, but views and overrides will not take effect.
