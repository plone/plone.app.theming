1.0 (2012-04-15)
----------------

* Prevent AttributeError when getRequest returns None.
  [maurits]

------------------

* Moved the *views* and *overrides* plugins out into a separate package
  ``plone.app.themingplugins``. If you want to use those features, you need

  [elro]

  [optilude]

  by using the ``host`` parameter.
  [optilude]

* Removed 'notheme' support: This can be handled within the rules file syntax
  by using the ``path`` parameter.
  [optilude]

* Added ``path`` and ``host`` as parameters to the Diazo rules file. These
  can now be used as conditional expressions.
  [optilude]

* Removed dependency on XDV in favour of dependency on Diazo (which is the
