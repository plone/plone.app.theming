Changelog

  using GZIP compression for anonymous
  (see ticket `12038 <https://dev.plone.org/ticket/12038>`_). [ebrehault]

  this so debugging can be displayed

1.1a2 (2012-08-30)
------------------

- Protect the control panel with a specific permission so it can be
  delegated.
  [davisagli]

- Advise defining ajax_load as ``request.form.get('ajax_load')`` in

  ajax_load input, which would give an unthemed page after submitting
  the form.

  prefs_main_template to avoid inserting CSS and JavaScript too early
  under plonetheme.classic.
  [danjacka]

------------------

- Replace the stock "Themes" control panel with a renamed "Theming" control
  panel, which incorporates the former's settings under its "Advanced" tab.

  better describe what's actually listed.

----------------

* Prevent AttributeError when getRequest returns None.
  [maurits]

  [elro]

1.0b7 - 2011-06-12
------------------

* Moved the *views* and *overrides* plugins out into a separate package
  ``plone.app.themingplugins``. If you want to use those features, you need

  [elro]

  [optilude]

* Use plone.subrequest 1.6 features to work with IStreamIterator from

  [optilude]

* Removed 'domains' support: This can be handled with the rules file syntax
  by using the ``host`` parameter.
  [optilude]
  
* Removed 'notheme' support: This can be handled within the rules file syntax
  by using the ``path`` parameter.
  [optilude]
  
* Added ``path`` and ``host`` as parameters to the Diazo rules file. These
  can now be used as conditional expressions.
  [optilude]
  
* Removed dependency on XDV in favour of dependency on Diazo (which is the
  new name for XDV).
