Require `plone.base` 3.1.0 or higher, as we use its new `is_truthy` function.
This drops compatibility with Plone 6.0.
Releases 5.0.13 and 5.0.14 already use this new function, but don't specify the minimum requirement.
Release 6.0.0 is the same as 5.0.14, but with the new minimum requirement.
Meanwhile 5.0.15 has been made from branch 5.x instead of master, and this uses its own version of the `is_truthy` function, instead of requiring the one from `plone.base`.
See `issue 263 <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.theming/issues/263>`_.
